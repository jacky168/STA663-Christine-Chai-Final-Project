\section*{Executive Summary}

The Indian Buffet Process is a fundamental algorithm in Bayesian nonparametrics, and it models an infinite number of features to reveal the latent structure of the data. In this report, I implemented the algorithm in the paper ''Infinite Latent Feature Models and the Indian Buffet Process''~\cite{griffiths2005infinite}, performed code testing to ensure correctness, optimized the Python code, and compared my work with some other existing algorithms and/or packages. A simulated image dataset is used for generating the posterior sampling of the linear-Gaussian binary latent feature model with the Indian Buffet Process as the prior.
